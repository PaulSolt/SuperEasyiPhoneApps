*  7.0 Lesson - Firebase 101


## 7.1 Lecture - Firebase 101 ##

In this lesson you will learn how to get started with the basics of Firebase, which you can use to store data in the cloud. It is a JSON based cloud storage, which is very fast at storing JSON based data. However, Firebase is not a relational database.

## 7.3 Tutorial - Setup Firebase Using Cocoapods ##

1. Use the Firebase Quickstart and Tutorials for Swift
2. Open Terminal (Spotlight)
3. Install Cocoapods using Ruby `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal

	```bash
	Pauls-Mac-Pro:Firebase Demo paulsolt$ sudo gem install cocoapods
	Password:

	```

4. Create or start with an Xcode project in your Projects folder

5. Change directories in Terminal using the `cd directoryName` command (drag and drop Finder folder into Terminal)

6. The `pwd` command will print the working directory (current directory)

7. Using Terminal in your Xcode project directory run the commands

	```
	Pauls-Mac-Pro:Firebase Demo paulsolt$ pod init
	Pauls-Mac-Pro:Firebase Demo paulsolt$ open -a Xcode Podfile
	```
8. Delete everything in the Podfile
9. Add the text to your podfile

	```
	use_frameworks!
	pod 'Firebase', '>= 2.5.1'
	```

10. Run the pod installation command (wait a few minutes)

	```
	Pauls-Mac-Pro:Firebase Demo paulsolt$ pod install
	Updating local specs repositories
	
	CocoaPods 1.0.0.rc.1 is available.
	To update use: `gem install cocoapods --pre`
	[!] This is a test version we'd love you to try.
	
	For more information see http://blog.cocoapods.org
	and the CHANGELOG for this version http://git.io/BaH8pQ.
	
	Analyzing dependencies
	Downloading dependencies
	Installing Firebase (2.5.1)
	Generating Pods project
	Integrating client project
	
	[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `Firebase Demo.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
	Sending stats
	Pod installation complete! There is 1 dependency from the Podfile and 1 total
	pod installed.
	```

11. IMPORTANT: Open the .xcworkspace file instead of the .xcodeproj file to edit your app project using Firebase

12. You will see your project and the Pod as a joint project. You can edit the Podfile inside Xcode from now on.

13. Great Run your project! You've just setup Cocoapods and installed your first Cocoapod. You can use this technique for any open source or 3rd party SDK that supports Cocoapods.
