# Cost of an iPhone App #


Finding developers is hard and expensive. I don't have any recommendations other than the following:

1. UpWork.com (Ok talent for a prototype ~ $2-10k small projects)
2. TopTal.com (Best talent ~ $2-6k/week)
3. App Building Company
1. RoundedCo.com
2. http://martiancraft.com

4. App Cost Calculators
