## 3.3 Tutorial - iPhone App Flow 101 ##

When you start your first app there are a lot of things that are working behind the scenes. The Main.Storyboard file is the starting point from which a Single View Application creates your app's first (blank) screen (the ViewController, which is associated with your ViewController.swift code file).

## 3.5 Tutorial - How to Connect App UI to Code ##

In order to change the UI programmatically or dynamically in your app, you need to tell Xcode what UI element is attached to code. Creating these Outlets, `IBOutlet`s, allows you to get text input from a text field, `UITextField`, or change text displayed on screen `UILabel`.

## 3.6 Tutorial - What Is Auto Layout and How to Add Auto Layout to Your UI ##

iPhone 5, iPhone 6S, iPad Pro, and iPhone 6S+ all have different screen sizes. Apple created a layout tool to make your UI (user interface) adapt to the different sizes. Auto Layout will allow you to create UI once for an iPhone and have it just work for every modern iPhone size (iPhone 4S+).

## 3.7 Tutorial - How to Programmatically Add a UILabel Using Swift 2 ##

Adding UI via Storyboard is a good skill, but you need to learn how to do it in code as well. There are certain animation effects and dynamic interactions that are only possible via code. You will create a `UILabel` and set up all of it's attributes to display it on the screen where you want and how big you want. You can change it's font type, text size, text color, background color, position, and transparency.

## 3.9 Tutorial - Make It Physical With Spring Physics Animations ##

Animations are used in apps to help draw attention to different parts of your app's screen. They help you transition between pages of content and allow you to add a bit of polish to your app. To make your animations look more natural and believable, you will want to introduce non-linear motion using physics-based animations.

## 3.17 Code Exercise 2 - Change the Welcome Name Using a UITextField ##

You can make your app more dynamic (i.e.: customizable) if you add more settings that the user can change. Change the app so that the name that animates can change using a `UITextField` outlet. You should be able to change the name so that the message is relevant to the current user.

### Code Exercise ###

1. Add user input to change the message using the UITextField
2. Bonus:
	1. Change the font used in the Main.Storyboard file for your labels.
	2. Try and change the font size using another UITextField. Youâ€™ll have to convert a String to a Float using the Float() initializer.
	3. Make the keyboard disappear after text input.
