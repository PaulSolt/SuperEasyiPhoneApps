2.1 Tutorial - Your First Xcode Project and the iOS Simulator


Xcode is going to be your friend over the next several months (or years), so you’ll need to get the hang of it by experimenting with it. Now is your chance to get acquainted with Xcode and its intricacies.

Insert your first line of code to print your name using the print() function.

Code is picky: if you don’t type it exactly as it expects you to, it won’t work. Code is also case-sensitive and spelling-sensitive … in fact, you might learn how to spell English words better by coding.

The Simulator is used to simulate any kind of iOS device, Apple Watch, or Apple TV. What’s great about this is that you can run your app in a virtual iPhone 6S, an iPhone 4, or an iPad Pro without having to buy any hardware.

With that said, the Simulator doesn’t let you test everything. Certain features and hardware sensors are only available on a real device. 

Some of the time you will be testing your app on the Simulator (because it’s the fastest!), but every now and then (when you want to show your app off) you are going to be running it on your real iPhone . . . this makes you an iPhone app developer!

Code File
The code file that you’re going to work with is the ViewController.swift file. This file goes along with the storyboard file that you’ll become familiar with in the next video.

The viewDidLoad() method is the first chunk of code that will run in your new iPhone app. You can insert any kind of code that you want to play with inside that code block.

	import UIKit
	
	class ViewController: UIViewController {
	    
	    override func viewDidLoad() {
	        super.viewDidLoad()
	        
	        print("Hi Paul Solt")
	    }
	}


2.2 Tutorial - Play with UI using Storyboards in Xcode 7

Storyboards are a feature in Xcode that allow you to drag-and-drop User Interface (UI) elements on the iPhone canvas.

Play around with the different UI elements from the bottom right side panel in Xcode (iPhone home button looking icon).

Left-click and drag any of the Buttons, Labels, or Sliders onto the Storyboard canvas (Main.storyboard).

2.3 Tutorial - Xcode 7 for Beginners - Panels and Editors

Xcode has a lot of panels that allow you to quickly hide and show additional information. The icons in the top right corner allow you to hide and show these panels—go try them out if you haven’t already done it yet!

If you’re working on a smaller laptop or computer monitor, you may want to hide some of the panels as you write code or design the UI.

The most important is the left panel: the Project Navigator. This gives you access to all of the resources that will be included in your iPhone app, along with any project settings you’ll need.

NOTE: When you just get started it’s very easy to check a setting, delete a file, and break something in your project (typo in your code file?).

If you run into a situation in which you can’t figure out what you did, just start a new Xcode project and start over. Re-write the code and see if that solves your problem.

The more projects you create with Xcode, the better. It’s a learning experience. I create a new project for every single idea or piece of code that I want to test out quickly… at this point I have created hundreds (maybe thousands) of Xcode projects.

2.4 Quiz - Xcode 7

Now it’s time to test your understanding. Throughout the course there will be quizzes to help you benchmark what you know.

I’m not going to grade these quizzes—you’ll do that yourself.
