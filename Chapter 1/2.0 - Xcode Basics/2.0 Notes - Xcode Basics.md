# 2.0 Notes - Xcode Basics #
  
## 2.1 Tutorial - Your First Xcode Project and the iOS Simulator ##



Xcode is an all-in-one tool that you will be using to create your iPhone apps. It combines source code, media files and data files, and it creates the apps that you see on the App Store.

In this lesson you will insert your first line of code using the print() function, which is used by developers to display text in the console window. Displaying output as your app runs is a helpful way to understand what is happening when your app is downloading files or processing new information.

Code is case sensitive and very picky: if you don’t type it exactly as Xcode expects, your code won't work. 

In Xcode you need to edit the `ViewController.swift` code file. Add the line of code `print("Hi Paul Solt")` inside the `viewDidLoad()` method, which is the first chunk of code that will run when your app starts on your iPhone. 

	import UIKit
	
	class ViewController: UIViewController {
	    
	    override func viewDidLoad() {
	        super.viewDidLoad()
	        // Add your print statement below 
	        //  ... this is a comment for you that Xcode ignores
	        print("Hi Paul Solt")
	    }
	}

## 2.2 Tutorial - Play With UI Using Storyboards in Xcode 7 ##

Storyboards are a feature in Xcode that allow you to drag-and-drop User Interface (UI) elements on the iPhone canvas. You'll use these virtual canvases to lay out the controls, images and text that will power your iPhone app.

Open the `Main.storyboard` file and then play around with the different UI elements from the bottom right side panel in Xcode (iPhone home button looking icon).

Left-click and drag any of the Buttons, Labels, or Sliders onto the Storyboard canvas.

## 2.3 Tutorial - Xcode 7 for Beginners - Panels and Editors ##

Xcode has a lot of panels that allow you to quickly hide and show additional information. The icons in the top right corner allow you to toggle these panels—go try them out if you haven’t already done it yet!

If you’re working on a smaller laptop or computer monitor, you may want to hide some of the panels as you write code or design the UI.

The most important is the left panel: the Project Navigator. This gives you access to all of the resources that will be included in your iPhone app, along with any Xcode project settings you’ll need.
