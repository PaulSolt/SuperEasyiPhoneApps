Welcome to Super Easy iPhone Apps!

Super Easy iPhone Apps is the starting place for anyone who wants to create an iPhone app. If you want to make apps as a hobby, to make additional income, or to switch careers—Super Easy iPhone Apps is the right course for you.

This course does not teach theory first, instead it is hands on, which means you will be learning how to create apps from day one. Everything you learn in this course is practical and the lessons will build upon each other.

## New to Apps and Programming? ##

You should watch each lesson sequentially if you have never written any code before. The lessons are designed for someone without any programming experience.

## Beginner Apple Developer? ##

Do you have some code experience with iOS, Apple Watch, Swift, Objective-C or Mac development?

If you have struggled in the past with Apple's documentation, courses, books, and tutorials, you should follow most of the lessons sequentially. These lessons will help you build a stronger foundation and help you overcome common issues.

You will find the *Lesson PDFs* and *Bug Fix* videos very helpful at solving problems that you may have encountered from your previous coding experiences.

## Experienced Developer?

This course series will teach you how to make iPhone apps from scratch. You will learn how to create apps quickly and how to recover from common beginner mistakes.

Using Super Easy iPhone Apps you will learn about code, design, app ideas, ways to monetize your apps, and skills that you will need to make iPhone apps a career path.

## Course Outcomes ##

1. You will be able to create iPhone apps.
2. You will be comfortable with getting help from the online community.
3. You will learn skills as you need them.
4. You will learn how to solve common problems with iPhone apps.
5. You will begin to think about apps beyond the code (App Store, marketing, design, ideas).

My goal is to help you  turn your ideas into apps and to 
My goal is to help you get started with iPhone apps as quickly as possible, while avoiding common problems.
My goal is to get you making your first iPhone app as quickly as possible. Please watch the next two videos about getting started and learning important changes happening with Apple and iPhone apps.

Homework
1.	Introduce yourself on the community forum (a little about yourself, any code experience you have, and why you want to make apps).
2.	Tell us (or PaulSolt@iPhoneDev.tv) when you plan to spend time making your iPhone apps: morning, evening; number of hours; days of the week, etc.

1.2 Lecture - Welcome to Super Easy iPhone Apps

If you’ve already set up your Mac computer (2008+) with El Capitan, Xcode 7, and a notebook, then you are ready to begin.

A notebook is required for you to learn faster. Use it to track your progress, ask questions (and keep track of previous questions), and sketch your app ideas. This is a learning hack that they don’t teach in college or high school.

A notebook is a handy place to track your progress so that if you take a vacation from iPhone apps, you can get back up to speed and pick up where you left off in no time!

If you haven’t set up your computer—or if you are looking to buy a Mac—check out my videos on getting started.

1.3 Lecture - Important watch before you proceed

Xcode, iOS, and Swift are always changing—that’s just how technology works.

In order to stay on top of iPhone apps, you need to make sure you are using the latest published version of Xcode. I don’t recommend using Beta versions of Xcode, since there may be bugs or code changes that are not stable.

If Apple changes something, you’ll get additional resources to help you work through any changes. Keep your eyes on the lookout for any updates about making iPhone apps.

Important Email Updates
If you want to stay up to date on changes, you need to do two things:

1.	Add PaulSolt@iPhoneDev.tv to your list of contacts
2.	Move Paul Solt’s messages to your Primary inbox (if you use Gmail)

This is the best way to learn about important changes and stay aware of new videos to help you build iPhone apps faster.

1.4 Lecture - 6 Macs you can use for making iPhone apps

There are a variety of Mac computers in Apple’s lineup.

My top recommendations are the Macbook Pro 13” or the iMac 21.5”.

Your budget, portability, editing, and gaming factors may change which Mac is best for you. If you have a question, send me an email: PaulSolt@iPhoneDev.tv.

¥	Bare Minimum: Mac 2008+, 4GB RAM, 128GB
¥	Recommended: Mac 2012+, 8GB RAM, 256GB+

1.5 Lecture - How to Download and Install El Capitan 10.11

El Capitan is a requirement moving forward if you want to make apps for iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPad, and the iPad Pro. Not all the features are supported on Yosemite.

Download El Capitan and install now.

If you have mission critical work files, please make sure you check compatibility with your work software.

IMPORTANT: Back up any of your files, music, documents, photos before you upgrade (and it’s a good idea to have these backed up to a Time Machine, another external drive, and Dropbox, etc.) I use dropbox.com to sync all my important files, github.com for my source code/apps (other good options are Time Machine and CrashPlan.com).

1.6 Lecture - How to Download and Install Xcode 7

Xcode 7 is the latest version of Xcode, and it is packed with a ton of great features. Xcode is the tool with which you’ll write code, design user interfaces (drag + drop), import images/audio/videos, and add data files and databases to power your iPhone apps.

Download Xcode and install it now.

Xcode combines all your files into a single executable (app) that you can run on any of the devices Apple creates. You can make an app for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch using Xcode along with Swift.

1.7 Lecture - What programming language for iPhone apps - Swift or Objective-C?

In this course you are going to learn Swift.

It is easier to start than Objective-C (the other Apple programming language).

What’s more important than the language is learning the APIs.

iOS uses Cocoa Touch, which provides all the functionality for buttons, multiple screens, transitions, animations, and gesture input. If you learn how to use thesis APIs, those skills are directly transferable to making apps with Objective-C.

Objective-C is important to learn after Swift if you plan to work for a company building apps or if you need to integrate with Open Source code projects.

Swift is the future of all apps, and everything is going to transition to it. You should start with it first because it is easier. If you’re coming from Java, C++, C, C#, Javascript, Ruby, Python, or any other programming language, it is also going to look intimately familiar. 

1.8 Lecture - What device should I make an app for?

If you are new to programming and have ideas for the Apple TV, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch, you should start with iPhone apps.

Why?

Because more likely than not, you have an iPhone in your pocket right now . . . and it is easier to make apps for something that is always with you.

Learning how to code Swift with iPhone apps is a lot easier than any of the other platforms. Also, any app for Apple Watch must be part of an iPhone app, so you need to learn that just to get the app to install on your Apple Watch.

Once you get the hang of it, you can start to learn how to make apps for your new Apple TV, iPad Pro, or Apple Watch.
