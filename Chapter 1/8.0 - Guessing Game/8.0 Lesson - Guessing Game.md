## 8.1 Lecture - Introduction to the Number Guessing Game ##

In this lesson you will build a new iPhone app from start to finish. The app will teach you how to design an apps UI (user interface), get user input, and write code to power your app. This lesson will reinforce the Swift Basics concepts with a practical application.

## 8.2 Tutorial - Design the User Interface in Xcode ##

Your first goal is to get more comfortable with Xcode and the `Storyboard` user interface files. Drag labels, text fields, and buttons to create the prototype app UI. Right now it will be non-functional, but you'll fix that in an upcoming step.

### Design Your User Interface Top to Bottom ###

Open your `Main.Storyboard` file and from the Object Library on the bottom of the right panel in Xcode drag UI elements onto the `ViewController` canvas:
 
1. Create a title `UILabel`: `Higher or Lower Game`
	1. Adjust the font to bold and point size
	2. Resize the label using  `Xcode > Editor > Size to Fit Content`
		1. Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd>
2. Add an input `UITextField` for the user to type numbers
	1. Adjust the font centering
3. Add a message `UILabel` with a starting message: `Guess a number`
4. Add a `UIButton` named `Guess`
5. Add a `UIButton` named `Reset`

Run your app by pressing the `Play` button in the top left and you should see the start of your iPhone app.

## 8.3 Tutorial - Connect the UI to Code With Outlets and Actions ##

To make your apps responsive and interactive to user input, you need to create a connection between the UI and the code.

### How to Make Outlet and Action Connections ###

1. Open the Assistant Editor using the Venn Diagram button in the top right corner (<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>)
2. Right-click and drag from a UI element (i.e.: UIButton) to the code file (two-finger click and drag on a trackpad)
	1. Sometimes Xcode displays Manual or nothing (a bug!) in the top jump bar above the code on the right side.
	2. If that happens, click on where it says `Manual` and change it to `Automatic`
3. Type a name for the variable and choose Outlet or Action for the type of connection (see below)

### Outlet and Action Connections ###

1. Make `Outlet` connections for any UI element you want to change or access in code (i.e.: message label and the input text field)
2. Make `Action` connections for any UI element you want to make something happen (i.e.: Guess and Reset buttons)

### Create Outlets and Actions Using the Following Names ###

1. Outlet for the UITextField named: textField
2. Outlet for the message UILabel named: messageLabel
3. Action for the Guess UIButton named: guessButtonPressed
4. Action for the Reset UIButton named: resetButtonPressed

### Spelling and Capitalization ###

Spelling and capitalization are important. You will use camel case for the name, which is common in programming languages for variable and method names. The first letter is lower-case, and every word after is capitalized to make it easy to read.

## 8.4 Bug Fix - iPhone App Crashes on Start ##

If your app crashes on start it is most likely because you broke one of your connections that you made between your Storyboard and code file.

This crash can happen if you rename an Outlet or Action connection in your code file, but don't change it in the Storyboard file.

1. In the bottom Console panel, scroll to the top of the error message looking for where it says `class is not key value coding-compliant for the key: YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME`
2. Track down the UI element that you gave the name (key) in your Storyboard file
3. Right-click on the UI element (i.e.: UILabel or UITextField)
4. Click the `X` button next to the old name
5. Reconnect the UI element to your code file
6. Run your app again
7. Repeat these steps if you have any other crashes

## 8.5 Tutorial - Auto Layout for Beginners ##

When you run your iPhone app you will notice that the UI doesn't look the same as you might expect from the Storyboard file. Your center aligned UI elements are not centered in the iPhone app.

When you first design your user interface Xcode will pin your UI elements in place, they don't resize or move based on the size of the iPhone or iPad.

You need to explain to Xcode how to position and size your UI design using Auto Layout. Auto Layout is a rule based system where you specify positions and sizes of every element in your iPhone app's user interface.

### Add Auto Layout Constraints in Storyboard ###

1. Open your `Main.storyboard` file
2. Right-click and drag from your UI elements to the canvas view or other UI elements to create new layout rules
3. You need to establish size and position for every UI element

### How to Think About UI Layout ###

When you think about app layouts, instead of thinking about exact pixels, you should think in terms of relative sizes and positions. On an iPhone 6S+ your UI will look slightly different than on an iPhone 6S because they have different screen sizes. Auto Layout helps you establish rules that the iPhone can follow so that your UI design will look good on any iPhone size.

Position your labels, buttons, images, and text fields relative to each other or anchored to the center and sides of your iPhone screen.

### 8.6 Tutorial - Random Numbers and User Input ###

Your first task is to get user input from the user. In this app you will work with Integer numbers (i.e.: whole numbers) and you will have the iPhone pick a number to guess.

### Pick a Random Number Between 1 and 100 ###

1. Create a property to store a random `Int` property

		code
	
2. Create a method to pick a random number called `pickRandomNumber()`

		code

3. Call the `pickRandomNumber()` at the bottom of your `viewDidLoad()` method

		code
		
4. Use the arc4_uniform(100) function to pick a number between 0 and 99
5. Add 1 to the number to shift the range from [0-99] to [1-100]

		code


### User Input From a UITextField ###

	code
		
1. In the `guessButtonPressed(_:)` method you will need to get the text that the user typed.
2. Convert the text `String` into an `Int` number.
3. You will use this guess to compare to the iPhone's random `number`




Compare the guessed number to the number that  Use the `textField.text` property to get input from the user when they press guess
