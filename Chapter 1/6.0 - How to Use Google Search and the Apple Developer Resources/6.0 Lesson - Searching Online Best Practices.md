## 6.1 Lecture - Searching Online Best Practices ##

In these lessons you will learn how to take advantage of Google search, Apple's developer resources, code documentation, WWDC videos, and more. 

These are resources that I leverage when I get stuck, when I have problems, or when I don't know what to do next. The internet makes it much easier to learn quickly from technical bloggers and other developers.
