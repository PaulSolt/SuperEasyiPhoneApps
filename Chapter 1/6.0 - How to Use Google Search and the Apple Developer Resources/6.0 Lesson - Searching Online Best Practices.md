## 6.1 Lecture - Searching Online Best Practices ##

In these lessons you will learn how to take advantage of Google search, Apple's developer resources, code documentation, WWDC videos, and more. 

These are resources that I leverage when I get stuck, when I have problems, or when I don't know what to do next. The internet makes it much easier to learn quickly from technical bloggers and other developers.


## 6.2 Tutorial - How to Use the Apple Developer Resources ##

Apple has many great resources that include code reference, programming guides, UI guides, and WWDC (World Wide Developer Conference) videos.

1. Visit the Apple Developer Resources
2. Search for topics on the iOS Developer Library
3. Read iPhone App Guides
4. Watch WWDC Videos
5. Search for topics with ASCII WWDC

ASCII WWDC is a great site for searching the transcripts from all WWDC videos, which makes it easier to find any reference to a video that shows how to use a new feature on iOS, Swift, or Xcode.

## 6.3 Tutorial - Google Search Best Practices ##

Google search is a very valuable resource for every programmer. There are certain strategies and best practices you should leverage to become more effective at finding helpful resources.

1. Looking at the UIKit User Interface Catalog for names of relevant terms of app UI.
2. Search relevant terms like "Swift 2", "Xcode 7", "iOS9", and any terms based on what you are trying to learn.
	1. Add terms like: "tutorial", "guide", "code sample"
3. Limit results by date
4. Try code samples and see what works

## 6.4 Tutorial - How to Use StackOverflow to Get Technical Help ##

Stackoverflow is a great website to get help from the technical community. It is a website composed of questions and answers. Chances are that your question has already been asked, you might have an answer already available to try.

1. Use search terms like: "Swift", "ios", "xcode", "\[xcode7\]", "\[swift2\]"
2. Remove words to simplify error message searching from Xcode.

	1. `*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[<Github_Xcode_Demo.ViewController 0x7fe292452de0> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key label.'â€‹`
	
	2. Should be edited to: `NSUnknownKeyException this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key`
	3. Or:  `swift class not key value coding-compliant for key`
