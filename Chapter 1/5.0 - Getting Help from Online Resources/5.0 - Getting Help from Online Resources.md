#5.1.1 Lecture - Getting Help Quickly from Online Resources

There are a ton of great online resources for iPhone apps. The biggest challenge for a beginner is learning which resources are best for the task at hand. Google and general searching skills are key to finding answers to common bugs or learning brand new APIs (application programming interfaces) that Apple releases each year.

In these lessons you will learn how to take advantage of Google, search, Markdown, the Super Easy Apps Community forum, Apple's developer resources, code documentation, WWDC videos, and more. 

These are resources that I leverage when I get stuck, when I have problems, or when I don't know what to do next. The internet makes it much easier to learn quickly from technical bloggers and other developers.

#5.2.1 Tutorial - How to Ask Questions that Get Answered Quickly

Your most important skill is helping yourself get help.

Super Easy Apps is an approachable community of people that want to learn and who want to use the latest technology from Apple to execute on their own visions. You might be job searching or you might be thinking about your next million dollar app idea. Either way, it's really important to connect with like minded individuals so that you can make progress towards your goals.

I have set up a variety of places for you to get help from both myself, my staff, and your peers.

1. In the course, your first stop should be the Disqus comments below the [course videos](http://courses.SuperEasyApps.com), see if anyone else has posted a tip or suggestion.
2. If you think your question is helpful to others, post a question on the [Super Easy Apps Community forum](http://community.SuperEasyApps.com).
3. If your ready to learn with access to a private community, the iPhone Mastermind might be right for you. There is a waitlist right now, and it will be opening back up later in the year.
