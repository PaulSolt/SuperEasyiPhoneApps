#5.1.1 Lecture - Get Help Quickly from Online Resources

There are a ton of great online resources for iPhone apps. The biggest challenge for a beginner is learning which resources are best for the task at hand. Google and general searching skills are key to finding answers to common bugs or learning brand new APIs (application programming interfaces) that Apple releases each year.

In these lessons you will learn how to take advantage of Google, search, Markdown, the Super Easy Apps Community forum, Apple's developer resources, code documentation, WWDC videos, and more. 

These are resources that I leverage when I get stuck, when I have problems, or when I don't know what to do next. The internet makes it much easier to learn quickly from technical bloggers and other developers.

  
#5.1.2 Lecture - How to Learn iPhone Apps Programming Faster
  
To learn faster, you need to be proactive. I keep a notebook (Moleskine squared) with me where I write down things that I'm working on, as well as questions that I need to answer.

Keeping track of what you're working is super important to stay productive and not get side tracked, plus it can give you a place to return when you take a short walk, stretch break, or lunch break.

## Join the Community ##

Super Easy Apps is an approachable community of people that want to learn and who want to use the latest technology from Apple to execute on their own visions. You might be job searching or you might be thinking about your next million dollar app idea. Either way, it's really important to connect with like minded individuals so that you can make progress towards your goals.

I have set up a variety of places for you to get help from both myself, my staff, and your peers:

##Helpful Resources

1. In the course, specific questions (not big code questions) can be answered/asked below [each course video](http://courses.SuperEasyApps.com)
2. If you have a code or user interface (UI) question, use the [Super Easy Apps Community forum](http://community.SuperEasyApps.com)
3. Take time to answer questions on the [Super Easy Apps Community forum](http://community.SuperEasyApps.com), because this will help you learn faster in addition to helping someone else.
4. If you want more real-time help and discussion, the private [iPhone Mastermind group](http://iPhoneMastermind.com) might be right for you.

#5.2 Tutorial - How to Ask Questions that Get Answered Quickly

When you have a problem, it's important that you seek help in a manner that others can answer your question without tons of effort.

It is important to be concise and clear to get help the fastest.

Have you ever received an email that was super long and asked a question at the very end? Maybe you've sent a couple of emails that were like that and never got a response.

When you ask short, concise, and clear questions you will get faster responses. 

You should strive to ask a question within 1-3 sentences, and you can follow your question with some more details on what your issue is.

## Email Question Checklist ##

1. Should this question be asked on the [community forum](http://community.SuperEasyApps.com)? Would it help others?
2. Did you attach a .zip (or github/dropbox link) of your entire Xcode project or Playground?
3. Did you test your .zip file on your Desktop (unzip and run the project)?
4. Is your question clear and concise (i.e. 1-3 sentences)?
5. Do you need to attach any screenshots or Youtube video links (30 second video)?

## Email Your Question to an iOS Developer ##
Please use this format when you email Paul (or anyone else).

### Subject ###

Do: Write a clear and descriptive title for your email 
>>My iPhone app was rejected from the App Store
>>
>>Crashing bug in viewDidLoad using touch gestures 

Don't: Write a generic message or I won't prioritize your email if it's a blocking problem
>>Hey
>>
>>question

### Body ###

Ask your question in the beginning, not the end. Use 1-3 sentences.

>>Hey Paul,
>> 
>> I was following along in video X and I had an issue that I can't solve. Can you look at my code sample (.zip Xcode project) that I have attached?
>>
>>Thanks for your time!
>>
>>-John

#5.3.1 Tutorial - How to Use the Discourse Community Forum

The [Super Easy Apps Community forum](http://community.SuperEasyApps.com) is a great place to get help.

To keep the discussion relevant, helpful, and easy to read please use the following features.

## Like It ##

If you just want to show appreciation for a helpful response or answer, use the like button (heart).

## Quoted Reply ##

You can select text in a previous response and then press "Quoted Reply" to insert a snippet of the previous response in your new post. 

You can even do this multiple times to group responses or to address different points.

I recommend using this approach when responding, because it makes it easier to follow who is responding to what. By including some context, it's a lot easier to answer a question or provide feedback on your ideas.

## Linked Topic Post ##

To keep message threads relevant, if you want to ask a question that is similar, just click on the plus icon (+) on the right to start a new Topic from the current post. 

This linked Topic is a great way to start a separate conversation based on an existing conversation, without overtaking the main point of original question.

# 5.3.2 Tutorial - CommonMark and Markdown Formatting #

You need to learn Markdown or CommonMark text formatting.

It is a text format that will enable you to create HTML markup (i.e. formatted webpage/blog post content) without learning HTML code.

Markdown was created by John Gruber, but it hasn't been updated since 2004.

CommonMark is a community standard built off of the Markdown format. It is becoming an open standard and fixes bugs and inconsistencies from the original Markdown format.

You can use Markdown to write a book, ebook, github.com project README, github.com comments, reddit comment, Squarespace post (Markdown widget), or a Discourse post (i.e. [Super Easy Apps Community forum](http://community.SuperEasyApps.com)), etc.
